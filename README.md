# django-sqlcipher

SQLCipher is an SQLite extension that provides transparent 256-bit AES encryption of database files.

In order to encrypt a new database or query existing data you must key it before using it.

This app does it for you. You only need to specify the database key in your project's `settings.py` file.

For more about SQLCipher take a look at [http://sqlcipher.net/](http://sqlcipher.net/).

## Requirements

* python-sqlcipher (Python compiled with SQLCipher support)

For more about python-sqlcipher take a look at:

## Installation

`pip install git+http://github.com/codasus/django-sqlcipher#egg=sqlcipher`

Or manually place it on your `PYTHON_PATH`.

## Configuration

Open your project's `settings.py` file and:

1. Append `sqlcipher` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`.

2. Set your database engine to `sqlcipher.backend`.

3. Optionally, type your key into your settings file (**unsafe**):

    `PRAGMA_KEY = "YOUR DATABASE KEY"`

You may not wish to expose your encryption key in a file. 
django-sqlcipher ships with custom management commands that will prompt
for the key when invoking `runserver` and `migrate`, however you
should consider how you want to set `django.conf.settings.PRAGMA_KEY`
at runtime in your production environment.
